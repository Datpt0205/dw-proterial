# Sales (Proterial Vietnam) — DW1 Đơn hàng & Báo giá

This repo became the Proterial product repo on 2026-10-02: `origin` is
`github.com/Datpt0205/dw-proterial` (public; Đạt keeps it public for now).
The platform seed stays in `Datpt0205/codebase`. DW01 (procurement) keeps
running in `C:\Users\phung\dw` and gets no new features; it moves here when a
Purchasing DW for Proterial is signed (estimated 30–51 person-days).

## State

- Context `dw_sales` scaffolded with `scripts/new_context.py` (14 seams).

  behind real ports. Spec: `sales/dw1-portal-demo/spec.md`. Tickets 01–10 in
