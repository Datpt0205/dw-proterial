# image, so the rule for every line below is: nothing here is worth reaching.
#
# It holds no application package, no database driver, no object-store client
# and no credentials. What it does hold is a document toolchain — the brandkit
# engine, the five OOXML libraries, LibreOffice for PDF, poppler for page
# images, pandoc for reading text back out — and a service with four routes.

# Security updates from the base image's distribution, applied at build time.
# The runtime stage installs no packages of its own, so everything trivy reports
# here comes from the base — and a base image is rebuilt on its own schedule,
# which is slower than a CVE with a released fix deserves. Measured on
# 2026-09-18: three HIGH `libpcre2` issues (out-of-bounds write, arbitrary code
# execution via a crafted regular expression), all already fixed upstream.
# Deliberately `upgrade`, not a pinned package list: the next one will be in a
# different library, and a list would have to be edited to find it.

# libreoffice-writer-nogui: DOCX -> PDF with no X11 and, deliberately, no JRE.
#   The Java stack is only needed by Base and by some filters; if a conversion
#   turns out to need it the image test fails loudly rather than silently
#   producing a blank page, and the fix is one package.
# poppler-utils: pdftoppm, which turns a PDF page into an image the QA gate can
#   look at.
# pandoc: reads text back out of a generated file, which is how the number check
#   sees what the document actually says.
# fonts-liberation + fonts-dejavu-core: metric-compatible with the Office fonts
#   and both cover Vietnamese diacritics. A .docx does not embed fonts, so these
#   only make the server-rendered PDF match what Word shows.
