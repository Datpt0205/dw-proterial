"""Every tenant table has RLS — asked of the catalog, not of the migrations.

`scripts/verify_invariants.py` reads migration TEXT, which is the right thing
for a check that runs without a database and catches a `CREATE TABLE` that
forgot its policy. It cannot see a table the text never names.

A partition is exactly that table. `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`
on a partitioned parent applies its policies to rows reached THROUGH the parent;
a partition addressed by its own name uses its own settings. Both default
partitions had none, and `dw_app` holds SELECT on them, so this returned every
tenant's rows with no `app.tenant_id` set at all:

    SELECT count(*) FROM platform.audit_events_default;

Found by trying it. This test is what makes the next one fail loudly — including
a partition added months from now, which Postgres will not police on its own.
