"""Durable ingest-job queue (B5).

The API ``enqueue``s a job (raw file already in object storage) and returns 202;
the worker ``claim_next``s one, runs parse→chunk→embed→index via the gateway, then
``mark_done``/``mark_failed``. Tenant isolation is enforced by RLS: enqueue/get run
under ``app.tenant_id``; the cross-tenant drain scan runs under ``app.worker_drain``.
