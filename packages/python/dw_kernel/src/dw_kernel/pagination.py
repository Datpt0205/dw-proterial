"""Keyset pagination: the one page shape every list endpoint returns.

A list endpoint that takes only ``limit`` hands a client the first page and
nothing after it. The obvious repair is ``OFFSET``, and it is wrong twice over.
Skipping N rows costs the database a scan of those N rows, so page 500 costs
five hundred pages of work; and a row inserted while a client is paging shifts
every later page down by one, so a record slides across the boundary the client
has already passed and is never returned at all. Both failures grow with the
tenant's data, which is to say they arrive first on the largest customer.

Keyset pagination remembers *where* the previous page ended — the sort key plus
the row id that breaks ties — and asks for rows strictly beyond that point. The
database seeks to the position through an index instead of counting to it, and
an insert elsewhere in the table cannot move a boundary that is expressed as a
value rather than as a count.

The cursor is deliberately opaque: a base64url blob, not a number. A client that
can compute "page 7" will, and from that moment the page size, the sort column
and the ordering are all part of the contract we have to keep forever. It also
carries a fingerprint of the query it was issued for, so a cursor replayed
against different filters is refused instead of quietly answering from a window
that does not describe it.

The encoding is *not* signed, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight.
Anyone can base64-decode a cursor and edit it; all that buys them is a different
window into a result set they are already authorized to read, because every
query still runs under the caller's verified tenant context and RLS. Signing
would require a secret, and the kernel has no configuration by design.
