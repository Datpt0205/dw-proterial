"""A run records every artifact version it ran under — on the row, not the span.

`configs/workers/README.md` says a run records them "so a result can be traced
back to the exact artifacts that produced it". Before migration 0005 that was
true of the OpenTelemetry span and false of `platform.worker_runs`, which held
the worker and graph version and none of the other four. A span is sampled and
expires; a claim about provenance that only a span can answer is not a claim
the system of record supports.

So it is asserted here against real SQL rather than against the store's own
return value: the point is that the columns exist, that the insert fills them,
and that reading a run back gets the same four values the worker was pinned to.
