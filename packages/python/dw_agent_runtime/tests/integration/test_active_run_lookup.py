"""Integration: "is something still working on this subject" against real SQL.

A surface that triggers work it does not wait for polls this on a timer, so
three things have to hold against the database rather than against a fake: the
lookup reads the subject out of the run's JSON input, it counts only runs that
have not settled, and it cannot see another tenant's runs.

What a unit test cannot check is that the column, the caller's value and the
partial index in migration 0059 agree - a mismatch in any of the three turns
this into a sequential scan, or into a wrong answer.
