"""Runs one shell command under the containment budget and returns what it said.

The budget has three parts and each stops a different failure:

* `ulimit` in the shell, before the command runs, bounds CPU, address space,
  open files, forks and file size. A memory bomb or a fork bomb dies here.
* A wall-clock deadline in the parent, then `SIGKILL` to the whole process
  group. A script that sleeps forever, or one whose child outlives it, dies
  here.
* An output cap on the way back. A script printing an endless stream cannot
  make the caller allocate without bound.

The limits are set by the shell rather than by `preexec_fn` on purpose. This
service answers HTTP, so the process running it has threads, and `preexec_fn`
runs arbitrary Python between `fork` and `exec` — documented as unsafe with
threads, and the failure is a hang rather than an error. `ulimit` is applied by
the child shell itself, after `exec`, so no such window exists. It is also
irreversible: a process without privilege cannot raise a limit it has lowered,
so the command it prefixes cannot undo it.

Combined output goes to a temporary file rather than a pipe: a pipe makes the
parent's memory the limit, and the parent is the trusted side. That file lives
under the service's own scratch directory on the sandbox tmpfs, because the
container's root filesystem is read-only and there is no `/tmp` to fall back to.
It is unlinked as it is created, so the command whose output it holds has no
name to reach it by.
