"""What the outbox dispatcher does with an event, and what this worker refuses
to wire to one.

Two different things are under test here. The first is the dispatch machinery
itself - claim, deliver, mark, record a failure - which is generic and stays.
The second is a standing guarantee about this particular host: it owns no
handler of its own, so every effect hanging off an event is wired by the
composition root that wants it. That second guarantee is the one worth a test.
Deleting code is easy to undo by accident, and the failure mode it prevents is
expensive and silent - a bulk import announcing 1,666 created records, each
buying a paid model call nobody asked for.

The event types below are invented for this file. The dispatcher routes by key
and knows nothing about what an event means, so naming a real context's event
here would tie the platform's test to a package it does not have.
