"""The worker's chat-command seam (channels Z5, ADR 0007).

The platform worker hosts no graph, so it has no runner to resume a decided run
on and registers no decide command itself; a context that hosts its graph here
builds one with `build_channel_decision_command` over its runner and hands it to
`build_channel_commands`, which puts it first.
