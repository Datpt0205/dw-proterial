"""Scaffold a bounded context, wired into every seam the platform declares.

    scripts/new_context.py --name sales_chat

## Why this is a script and not a checklist

A context joins the platform at FOURTEEN places across eight files, and twelve
of them are configuration:

    packages/python/dw_<name>/            the package, five layers
    pyproject.toml                        uv.sources
    pyproject.toml                        ruff known-first-party
    pyproject.toml                        mypy mypy_path
    pyproject.toml                        coverage source
    pyproject.toml                        import-linter root_packages
    pyproject.toml                        import-linter contracts (its own,
                                          the platform's, independence)
    apps/api/.../bootstrap/wiring.py      build from the RuntimeSeam
    apps/api/.../main.py                  mount the router
    apps/api/pyproject.toml               declare the dependency
    apps/worker/.../main.py               register the consumer
    infra/docker/api.Dockerfile           two COPY lines
    infra/docker/worker.Dockerfile        two COPY lines
    scripts/verify_architecture.py        IMPORT_TO_DIST

`CLAUDE.md` has listed these for as long as the repo has existed and nobody had
ever walked them, because this repo deliberately ships no bounded context. The
list was nearly right: walking it turned up one missing entry,
`apps/api/pyproject.toml`, which `verify_architecture.py` caught the moment the
router was mounted. A list nobody executes is the failure mode this codebase
keeps finding in itself, so the list is executable now and CI walks it on every
push.

## What it generates

A context that RUNS, not a placeholder: a domain entity with a rule, a command
handler behind a port, a graph, a router that answers, and a test for the slice.
It has no database table — a real context adds migrations, and generating a
revision into the live chain is a worse default than leaving the one step a
human should think about.

The worker lane is written COMMENTED, alone among the seams. A generated context
owns no queue, so a registered lane would be a consumer with nothing to consume;
and `test_worker.py` asserts the exact set of lanes the process hosts, so a
context's lane arriving must be a deliberate change rather than one a scaffold
slipped in.

Deliberately NOT generated: prompts, tool specs, an eval dataset. Each is a
judgement about the product, and a generated one would be a plausible-looking
artifact nobody decided on — the same failure as a policy file nothing reads.
`CLAUDE.md` says what to add and the eval gate refuses a context without
security coverage, which is where that belongs.
