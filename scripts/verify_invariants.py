"""Check the four invariants this repository has actually broken.

Not a linter and not a generic security scanner — both already run in CI and
neither would have caught any of these. Each check below exists because the
failure it looks for happened here, was expensive to find, and is mechanical to
detect. The counts are from `.claude/rules/failure-modes.md`.

1. A tenant-scoped table without row-level security. Grants are inherited from
   `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`; RLS is not, and a tenant table without it is a
   cross-tenant read waiting to happen. Nothing enforced this before migration
   0007 went in with RLS only because it was remembered.

2. A field declared on a contract and read by nothing (found 10 times). `autonomy_level`
   was declared, validated and read nowhere, so a worker at A4 paused as often as
   one at A0. A control that is configured and unenforced reads like a safeguard
   in review and is discovered to be decoration by the first incident.

3. A value a `Literal` accepts that no code branches on (found 4 times). The schema
   took `approval_policy: conditional`, no branch matched it, and it silently
   behaved as `never` — so anyone who wrote it expecting a gate got none.

4. A runtime database engine that prints the row it failed on. SQLAlchemy's
   error text carries `[parameters: ...]`, the values being written: a mail
   body, a price, a model's answer. Every traceback a lane logs then puts
   them in the log store (Loki since 2026-11-05) unless the engine is built
   with `hide_parameters=True`. Found by the audit before logs left the host.

Usage: uv run python scripts/verify_invariants.py
Exit 0 clean, 1 violations.

Every check has an escape hatch with a mandatory reason. A checker with no way to
say "this one is deliberate" gets deleted the first time it is wrong, and then
none of it runs.
